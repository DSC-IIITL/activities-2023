## Overview  
This repository serves as the base for you to learn React concepts in a more better way. This repository showcases and demonstrates various modern JavaScript features and concepts.
In this tutorial, you will learn the essential concepts such as file structure of React, Export & Export Default, Hooks, Props, Tailwind CSS, API fetching and API linking.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin with this tutorial, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Before being able to run Javascript on Visual Studio Code, you need to install Visual Studio Code and NodeJS.
- Need to know some advanced Javascript concepts such as Arrow Functions, Exports, Array Functions, Destructuring, and Async JS (Promises).
- Before you start cloning the repository we recommend you to install the following extensions in your VS code:
  1) Prettier ESLint
  2) ESLint
  3) Live Share
  4) Tailwind CSS Intellisense
  5) PostCSS Language Support


## Cloning the Repository

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps to clone the repository to your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/activities-2023.git
   ```

   Replace `username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**: Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the cloned repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd activities-2023
   ```

## Running the files locally

After cloning the repository, you can run the files locally to run the react code. Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the watchlist folder:

   ```bash
   cd watchlist
   ```
1. **View in Browser**:To run the react app type the following command in your VS code terminal:
   
   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```
   Open your browser and search for localhost:5173. You will be able to see the web page rendered in your browser.
   
2. **Enabling the API fetch functionality**: Rename the .env.example file as .env . Generate one API KEY from omdb API website https://www.omdbapi.com/  . Replace 'OMDB_API_KEY=abcdef' by VITE_TOKEN='generated API Key'. Now refresh your browser page and search for any movie by typing its name in the search bar. The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by their users.

3. **Creating your watchlist**: Click on add to watchlist to add the movie in your watchlist. You can remove it anytime by clicking on the delete button.
